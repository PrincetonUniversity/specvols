# COV3D: 3D Covariance Estimation for Cryo-EM

### Joakim And√©n, Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation

To use, launch MATLAB/Octave and run `matlab/addpath_cov3d.m`. This will set up the paths.

The projection/backprojection functionality depends on nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) libraries that should be installed. This can be achieved using one of the commands `install_cims_nufft`, `install_chemnitz_nfft`, or `install_finufft`.
