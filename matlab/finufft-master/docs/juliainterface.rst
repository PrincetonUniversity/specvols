Julia interface
===============

Ludvig af Klinteberg has built an interface from the `julia <https://julialang.org/>`_ language.
This interface is found at
`this github repo <https://github.com/ludvigak/FINUFFT.jl>`_,
and is actually a secondary wrapper around our python interface,
so you should make sure that the latter is working first.
