To use, launch MATLAB `matlab/addpath_specvols.m`. This will set up the
paths.

This package requires the use of the FFTW and FINUFFT packages. These are
available at http://www.fftw.org/ and 
https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft, respectively.  Please follow
instructions for installations on those sites.

This code was written on Linux and has been tested on Windows and OSX as
well, but Linux is considered to be the "native environment" and we
recommend running it on Linux.

The scripts under specvols/matlab/figuresgen contain scripts that generate
data for figures in the paper.
